# Covid-19 Prediction Project

## Project Description

**Brief Description:**
The project was created in Python and is based on data from the "COVID-19 Data Hub." The aim of the work was to conduct both local and global analysis of the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Applied methods include machine learning models such as linear regression, multiple regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), regression trees, and random forest regression.

**Analysis Objectives:**
1. Predicting the number of deaths ("deaths") from COVID-19 at both the local and global levels.
2. Predicting the number of new cases ("confirmed") both locally and globally.

**Machine Learning Models:**
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Regression Trees
- Random Forest Regression

## Getting Started

Open the Jupyter notebook 'PELC_EWA_P1.ipynb' to explore the analyses and prediction results.

## Requirements

The project uses the libraries, which are imported in the initial cell of the notebook.

## Notes

- Data was retrieved from the "COVID-19 Data Hub." (Guidotti, E., Ardia, D., (2020), "COVID-19 Data Hub", Journal of Open Source Software 5(51):2376, doi: 10.21105/joss.02376.)
- The project is exploratory in nature, and the analysis results may be useful in understanding and predicting the development of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- All comments and text in the notebooks are written in Polish.

Thank you for your interest in the project!
